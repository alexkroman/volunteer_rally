How to install Volunteer Rally
==============================

1. Install the latest version of Drupal core 6.x into your web server's document root, as usual. We'll call Drupal's path [drupal].
2. Move this entire volunteer_rally directory into [drupal]/profiles/. This README file should be located at [drupal]/profiles/volunteer_rally/INSTALL.txt.
3. Run the rebuild.sh shell script from within the volunteer_rally_install directory by typing the following command into the command line from the volunteer_rally directory.
    ./rebuild.sh

   This will download all the modules, themes, and patches needed by Volunteer Rally.
4. Run Drupal's installer as usual and select the Volunteer Rally installation profile instead of Drupal. (You'll need to fill out the "Configure site" form as usual.)
5. Once the process completes, you should see the installer's final "Installation complete" message with a link to your home page.

We hope you enjoy Volunteer Rally!
