How to install Donor Rally
==========================

1. Install the latest version of Drupal core 6.x into your web server's document root, as usual. We'll call Drupal's path $DRUPAL.


2. Move this entire DonorRally directory into [drupal]/profiles/.


3. Rename the volunteer_rally directory to "volunteer_rally_install". You should be able to access this file at [drupal]/profiles/donor_rally_install/INSTALL.txt.


4. Run the rebuild.sh shell script from within the donor_rally_install directory by typing the following command into the command line from the donor_rally_install directory.

    ./rebuild.sh

This will download all the modules, themes, and patches needed by Donor Rally.


Now, run Drupal's installer as usual and select the Volunteer Rally install profile instead of Default:


Now you should see the Drupal installer's final "installation complete" with a link to your home page. We hope you enjoy Volunteer Rally!
